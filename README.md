# contentHidden

## Show Hidden Content
1. A link with an id of ```morelink``` is placed so that when clicked, it will display the content of the story. 
2. Before display/hidden functionality is defined in CSS and Javascript, the content of the div element with an id ```morediv``` will be always visible. 
3. Here the goal is to hide the content of the div element with an id ```morediv``` initially, and then dispaly it when the user activates the link. 
4. The display property of the ```morediv``` should be changed to "block" if it is "none", or to "none" if it is anything other than "none".
5. Initially, the content of ```morediv``` element should be hidden. This can be done either in CSS or in javascript. 
6. When you click the link, the content should now display below the headline and link instead of new story page. Clicking again should hide the story.
